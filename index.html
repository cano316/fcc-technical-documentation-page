            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the
                hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, and also covers some key terms
                about the language.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="how_css_is_structured">
            <header>How CSS Is Structured</header>
            <p>First, let's examine three methods of applying CSS to a document:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>External Stylesheet</li>
                <li>Internal Stylesheet</li>
                <li>Inline Styles</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>External stylesheet</h2>
            <p>An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a <code>.css</code> extension. This is the
                most common and
                useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages,
                styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. In the Getting started with CSS, we linked an external
                stylesheet to our web page.
                You reference an external CSS stylesheet from an HTML
                <code>link</code> element.
            </p>
            <h2>Internal stylesheet</h2>
            <p>An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS
                inside a <code>style</code> element contained inside the HTML <code>head</code>.</p>

            <p>In some circumstances, internal stylesheets can be useful. For example, perhaps you're working with a
                content management system where you are blocked from modifying external CSS files.</p>
            <p>But for sites with more than one page, an internal stylesheet becomes a less efficient way of working. To
                apply uniform CSS styling to multiple pages using internal stylesheets, you must have an internal
                stylesheet in every web page that will use the styling. The efficiency penalty carries over to site
                maintenance too. With CSS in internal stylesheets, there is the risk that even one simple styling change
                may require edits to multiple web pages.</p>
            <h2>Inline styles</h2>
            <p>Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a
                <code>style</code> attribute. The implementation of an inline style in an HTML document might look like
                this:
            </p>
            <p>Avoid using CSS in this way, when possible. It is the opposite of a best practice. First, it is the least
                efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within
                a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making
                everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier
                for all who work on the website.</p>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="the_box_model">
            <header>The Box Model</header>
            <p>Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create
                layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items. In this lesson, we will take a proper look at the
                CSS <em>Box Model</em> so that you can build more complex layout tasks with an understanding of how it
                works and the terminology that relates to it.</p>
            <h2>Block and inline boxes</h2>
            <p>In CSS we broadly have two types of boxes â€” <strong>block boxes</strong> and <strong>inline
                    boxes</strong>. These characteristics refer to
                how the box behaves in terms of page flow and in relation to other boxes on the page. Boxes also have an
                <strong>inner display type</strong> and an <strong>outer display type</strong>. First, we will explain
                what we mean by block box and
                inline box. We will then explain what is meant by an inner and outer display type.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="values_and_units">
            <header>Values and Units</header>
            <p>In CSS specifications and on the property pages here on MDN you will be able to spot value types as they
                will be surrounded by angle brackets, such as <code>color</code> or <code>length</code>. When you see
                the value type <code>color</code> as valid for a particular property, that means you can use any valid
                color as a value for that property, as listed on the <code>color</code> reference page.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="positioning">
            <header>Positioning</header>
            <p>Positioning allows us to produce interesting results by overriding normal document flow. What if you want
                to slightly alter the position of some boxes from their default flow position to give a slightly quirky,
                distressed feel? Positioning is your tool. Or what if you want to create a UI element that floats over
                the top of other parts of the page and/or always sits in the same place inside the browser window no
                matter how much the page is scrolled? Positioning makes such layout work possible.

                There are a number of different types of positioning that you can put into effect on HTML elements. To
                make a specific type of positioning active on an element, we use the <code>position</code> property.</p>
            <p>Types of positioning</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Static</li>
                <li>Relative</li>
                <li>Absolute</li>
                <li>Fixed</li>
                <li>Sticky</li>
            </ul>
